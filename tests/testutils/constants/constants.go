// Package constants holds the pieces of olake's external contract that the integration tests need
// to name: the driver identifiers it accepts on the command line, and the column it writes CDC
// event times into.
//
// These are restated here rather than imported from olake on purpose. A black-box suite that shared
// the product's own constant could not detect a contract break -- rename the CDC column and every
// test using the shared symbol recompiles clean and passes, sailing past the exact regression the
// suite exists to catch. The duplication is the mechanism, not the cost.
//
// It is a package of its own, rather than more surface on testutils, so the contract stays legible:
// what is here is what olake promises, and everything else in tests/ is harness.
